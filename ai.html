	<h1>AI In The Real World</h1>
	<h2>Deep Mind AI</h2>

		DeepMind is a division of Alphabet which is owned by Google, they're responsible 
		for developing general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI).
		
		Artificial intelligence is learning to decipher damaged ancient Greek engravings. The AI seems to be better than humans at filling in missing words, but may be most useful as a collaborative tool, where researchers use it to narrow down the options.
		There are thousands of ancient inscriptions we already know about, 
		with dozens more discovered every year. Unfortunately, many have become eroded
		or damaged over the centuries, resulting in segments of text being lost. Figuring 
		out what the gaps could be is a difficult task, involving looking at the rest of 
		the inscription and other similar texts.

		Yannis Assael at DeepMind and his colleagues trained a neural network, a type of 
		AI algorithm, to guess missing words or characters from Greek inscriptions, on 
		surfaces including stone, ceramic and metal, that were between 1500 and 2600 years old.

		The AI, called Pythia, learned to recognise patterns in 35,000 relics, containing 
		more than 3 million words. The patterns it picks up on include the context in which
		different words appear, the grammar, and also the shape and layout of the inscriptions.

		Given an inscription with missing information, Pythia provides 20 different suggestions 
		that could plug the gap, with the idea that someone could then select the best one using
		their own judgement and subject knowledge. “It’s all about how we can help the
		experts,” says Assael.

		To test the system, the team hid nine letters of a Greek personal name from Pythia. 
		It managed to fill in the blanks. In a head-to-head test, where the AI attempted to 
		fill the gaps in 2949 damaged inscriptions, human experts made 30 per cent more 
		mistakes than the AI. Whereas the experts took 2 hours to get through 50 inscriptions, 
		Pythia gave its guesses for the entire cohort in seconds.

		This shows the potential of AI-assisted restoration, says Thea Sommerschield at 
		the University of Oxford, who was part of the team. “The reward is huge because it 
		tells us about almost every aspect of the religion, social and economic life of the 
		ancient world,” she says.
